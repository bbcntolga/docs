title: "Credit Usage"
description: "Understand how credits are consumed across Aifano endpoints and how to monitor your usage."

## Overview

Aifano uses a credit-based billing system. Credits are consumed per page processed, with different rates depending on the operation. Free operations like file uploads and job status checks cost zero credits.

## Credit Pricing

| Operation | Credits per Page | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Parse** | 1 | Document parsing into structured JSON |
| **Extract** | 2 | Structured data extraction with schema |
| **Split** | 1 | Document splitting into sections |
| **Edit** | 1 | Document editing and form filling |
| **Pipeline** | 2 | Pipeline execution (varies by processors) |
| **Upload** | 0 | File upload to Aifano storage |
| **Job Status** | 0 | Checking async job status |
| **Cancel Job** | 0 | Cancelling a running job |

<Note>
  Credits are calculated based on the number of pages in the document. A 10-page PDF processed with `/extract` costs 20 credits (10 pages × 2 credits).
</Note>

## How Credits Are Calculated

Credits are charged **after** processing completes. The formula is:

```
credits = num_pages × credits_per_page
```

For example:
- Parsing a 5-page PDF: `5 × 1 = 5 credits`
- Extracting from a 10-page PDF: `10 × 2 = 20 credits`
- Splitting a 25-page document: `25 × 1 = 25 credits`

## Usage in Responses

Every API response includes a `usage` object showing credits consumed:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "duration": 2.34,
  "usage": {
    "num_pages": 5,
    "credits": 5
  },
  "result": { ... }
}
```

## Monthly Credit Limits

Each organization has a monthly credit limit. When the limit is reached, API requests return a `429` error:

```json
{
  "error": "Credit limit reached. You have used 1000 of 1000 credits this month. Please upgrade your plan or wait until next month.",
  "code": "CREDIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "credits_used": 1000,
  "credit_limit": 1000
}
```

## Monitoring Usage

### Via Studio

Track your credit usage in real-time through the [Aifano Studio](https://studio.aifano.com):

1. Navigate to **Credits** in the sidebar
2. View your current usage, remaining credits, and usage history
3. See a breakdown by operation type and endpoint

### Via API Response Headers

Each API response includes usage information in the response body. Track the `usage.credits` field to monitor consumption programmatically.

## Tips to Optimize Credit Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use jobid:// references to avoid re-parsing">
    If you've already parsed a document and want to extract different data, use `jobid://job_id` as input. This skips the parsing step and saves credits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use async for large documents">
    Async endpoints don't cost more credits, but they prevent timeouts on large documents — ensuring you don't waste credits on failed requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Batch similar operations">
    Use pipelines to combine parse + extract in a single call. This is more efficient than calling each endpoint separately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test with small documents first">
    Before processing large batches, test your configuration with a single small document to verify the output matches your expectations.

## Failed Requests

Credits are **not** charged for failed requests. If a request returns an error (4xx or 5xx status code), no credits are deducted from your account.

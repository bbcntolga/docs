## API Keys

All Aifano Platform API requests require authentication via a **Bearer token**. API keys are scoped to your organization and can be managed in the [Aifano Studio](https://studio.aifano.com).

### Key Format

Aifano API keys follow this format:

```
ak_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure. Never expose them in client-side code, public repositories, or browser requests. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://platform.aifano.com/parse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ak_live_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "https://example.com/document.pdf"}'
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer ak_live_your_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://platform.aifano.com/parse",
    headers=headers,
    json={"input": "https://example.com/document.pdf"}
)
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://platform.aifano.com/parse", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer ak_live_your_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ input: "https://example.com/document.pdf" }),
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Managing API Keys

### Creating a Key

1. Go to [studio.aifano.com](https://studio.aifano.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy the key immediately — it won't be shown again

### Revoking a Key

Revoked keys immediately stop working. Go to **Settings → API Keys** and click **Revoke** next to the key you want to disable.

### Key Scopes

API keys can be scoped to specific operations:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `parse` | Document parsing |
| `extract` | Data extraction |
| `split` | Document splitting |
| `edit` | Document editing |
| `upload` | File uploads |
| `*` | All operations (default) |

## Error Responses

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `401` | `Missing or invalid Authorization header` | No Bearer token provided |
| `401` | `Invalid API key format` | Key doesn't start with `ak_live_` |
| `401` | `Invalid API key` | Key not found or doesn't match |
| `401` | `API key has been revoked` | Key was revoked in Studio |
| `401` | `API key has expired` | Key passed its expiration date |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API key in an environment variable rather than hardcoding it:
    ```bash
    export AIFANO_API_KEY="ak_live_your_key_here"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Create new keys periodically and revoke old ones. This limits the impact of a compromised key.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use scoped keys">
    If a service only needs to parse documents, create a key with only the `parse` scope.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor usage">
    Check your API key usage in Studio to detect unusual activity early.

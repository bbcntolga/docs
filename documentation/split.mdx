```json
{
  "input": "aifano://document.pdf",
  "split_description": ["..."],
  "split_rules": "Each section must be non-overlapping. Include all pages of a section."
}
```

Default: *"Split the document into the applicable sections. Sections may only overlap at their first and last page if at all."*

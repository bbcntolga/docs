## Overview

Aifano enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and platform stability. Limits are applied per organization and vary by plan.

## Rate Limits by Plan

| Plan | Requests per Minute | Concurrent Jobs | Monthly Credits |
|------|--------------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| **Free** | 20 | 5 | 1,000 |
| **Pro** | 100 | 20 | 10,000 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom |

<Note>
  Contact [support@aifano.com](mailto:support@aifano.com) for Enterprise plan details and custom rate limits.
</Note>

## Concurrency Limits

Concurrency limits control how many documents can be processed simultaneously. This applies to both sync and async endpoints.

| Endpoint Type | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|--------------|-----:|----:|-----------:|
| Sync (`/parse`, `/extract`, etc.) | 5 | 20 | Custom |
| Async (`/parse_async`, etc.) | 5 | 20 | Custom |
| Upload (`/upload`) | 10 | 50 | Custom |

## Rate Limit Headers

Rate limit information is included in API response headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Maximum requests allowed per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets |

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please retry after 30 seconds.",
  "retry_after": 30
}
```

### Retry Strategy

Implement exponential backoff when you receive a `429` response:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import time
import requests

def call_with_retry(url, headers, json_data, max_retries=5):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=json_data)

        if response.status_code == 429:
            wait_time = min(2 ** attempt, 60)  # Max 60s
            print(f"Rate limited. Retrying in {wait_time}s...")
            time.sleep(wait_time)
            continue

        return response

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

```javascript JavaScript
async function callWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 5) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    const response = await fetch(url, options);

    if (response.status === 429) {
      const waitTime = Math.min(2 ** attempt, 60) * 1000;
      console.log(`Rate limited. Retrying in ${waitTime / 1000}s...`);
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, waitTime));
      continue;
    }

    return response;
  }

  throw new Error("Max retries exceeded");
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use async endpoints for batch processing">
    Submit all jobs via async endpoints first, then poll for results. This is more efficient than sequential sync calls and avoids hitting rate limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Implement exponential backoff">
    When you receive a `429` response, wait before retrying. Double the wait time with each retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...) up to a maximum of 60 seconds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor rate limit headers">
    Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` in response headers to proactively slow down before hitting the limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Spread requests over time">
    Instead of sending 100 requests at once, spread them evenly across the minute to stay within rate limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contact support for higher limits">
    If your use case requires higher rate limits, reach out to [support@aifano.com](mailto:support@aifano.com) to discuss Enterprise plans.

## Credit Limits vs. Rate Limits

| Type | Scope | Reset | Error Code |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| **Rate Limit** | Requests per minute | Every minute | `429` |
| **Credit Limit** | Credits per month | Monthly | `429` with `CREDIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` |

Rate limits restrict how fast you can make requests. Credit limits restrict how much processing you can do per month. Both return `429` status codes but with different error messages.
